1. Waht is mrubyRuby

The mrubyRuby is a wrapper of CRuby for mruby. You can use mruby through CRuby.
What is good it? I create it for joke, but I think it is useful. For example,

  Develop mruby software tools by cruby (Debugger, Inspecter)

  Debug or test mruby using the state of embedded other software

2. Install
   TODO

3. Sample
  
  require 'mruby'

  MRuby.eval('p "foo"')

MRuby.eval invoke mruby and eval argument string.
This version of mrubyRuby have onlu MRuby.eval method,
but I have idea about other method sand classes for conroling mruby detailedly.
